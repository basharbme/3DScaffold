# 3DScaffold
Thesis Project Code for 3D printed scaffold creation program
The goal of this project is to create a 3D printed scaffold for the treatment of critical size defects. This is a program written in python that allows a user to import a series of CT Scan images, and perform segmentation on it to generate a 3D volume of required bone matter. The program provides a GUI, and uses open-source libraries for processing the data.
